# VIN details API Getting Started
This project provides a RESTful API that when provided a VIN number will retrieve a vehicle's make, model and year.

The API leverages the NHTSA Vehicle API to obtain the vehicle details.

## Build and Run API
Clone the git repository or download as a zip and extract to a local directory i.e. ~/vinapi

Navigate to the project directory and run the following command to run the application

```console
./gradlew bootRun
```

This will build and run the application on the localhost at the default port of 8080.

## Testing the API
